# Heavy Engine 3D

This is the int13h Heavy Engine 3D framework, it's probably not for the faint hearted amoung you
it has many quirks and probably doesn't make complete sense to use, its more of a codebase we
build while learning how to build a WebGL/Canvas/HTML5 framework.

You are more than welcome to have a crack at using it ofcourse, there isn't really any documentation
for it at the moment, that may change over time. Though looking at a project that uses it should
make it even less obvious how it works. We'll get around to that at some point =P
